  In this exercise, you are asked to create a couple of buttons that, when clicked, trigger the display of popups. We want to not only see your coding skills, but also your eye for design and experience. Follow the instructions below and feel free to explain what you're doing or ask questions as you go.

  1. Create two buttons centered on the page, next to each other. One should be for canceling and the other for accepting, so use appropriate background colors. The buttons should have rounded borders and should brighten up a bit with easing on hover.

  2. Create two popups, one positioned a bit off from the bottom right corner of the page and the other from the top right. The popups should have rounded corners, a slightly thick border, and some padding. One popup should contain the text "Thank you!" while the other should contain the text "Come back soon."

  3. Now, position the two popups off screen to the right using CSS.

  4. We will now complete the exercise. Add a click handler to each button. For the first button, when clicked we want to slide the "Come back soon" popup from the right into view. For the second button, when clicked we want to slide the "Thank you!" popup from the right into view. The popups should slide back out of view 8 seconds after coming into view or when clicking anywhere on the page except the buttons and the popups.

  5. BONUS: Make this work for touch devices!

        <button class="accept" type="button">Accept</button>
        <button class="cancel" type="button">Cancel</button>

  == PLEASE FORK THIS CODEPEN TO CREATE YOUR OWN IMPLEMENTATION ==

  Instructions:

  In the HTML pane, add the necessary markup to recreate the newsletter component depicted in the image located at the top-right corner of the page. Style appropriately in the CSS pane.

  This component should be fluid, meaning it will adjust to fit the width of its parent container.

  We expect this exercise to take between 30-45 minutes, but take the time you need to submit work you're happy with.

  <!-- Book Listing Exercise
The purpose of this exercise is to explore your comfort building an output interface while working with a 3rd-party API. Specifically, you'll be building a small book listing webapp using either vanilla HTML/CSS/JS or your front-end framework of choice, leveraging the Goodreads Public APIs using the account credentials below:
Key: RDfV4oPehM6jNhxfNQzzQ
Secret: fu8fQ5oGQEDlwiICw45dGSuxiu13STyIrxY0Rb6ibI
Please fork the following CodePen to get started: https://codepen.io/dotdash/pen/eEwwRZ


Your application should be composed of a simple search box that upon enter or click of the "Search" button, triggers a search using a (provided) REST endpoint which proxies Goodreads' public APIs, transforms it into JSON, and adds CORS headers for client-side use. The results of the API call should be displayed in your app.


Bonus Points:
1. Include pagination in the UI.
2. Use components to render each book listing.
3. The metadata returned by the existing REST Runkit endpoint is somewhat limited. Fork the linked Runkit and expand the information returned to include addition. -->
